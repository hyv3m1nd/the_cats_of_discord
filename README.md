# the_cats_of_discord  

This personal project is to be developed.  
  
Discord is a popular social platform for gamers. Many gaming bots exist, and my friends and I have tried quite a few.  
The most popular ones in my friend group are OwO (a pokemon-like game), Virtual Fisher, and DankMemer.  
All these games let the players type a few commands every few seconds and accumulate stats over time. A simple typing bot could play it better than I can.  
  
The_Cats_of_Discord is a re-imagining of Discord gaming bots and their interactions with the Discord framework:  
Each Discord server is a household, and each channel is a room.  
Many cats, each with its own personality, roam the streets, houses, and rooms of Discord. Users can decorate rooms and interact with the cats. They can even spam commands--but beware--cats get agitated if they encounter the same commands too many times. The dynamic nature of this system will nullify most auto-typing bot.  
Hopefully the users will learn something about cats too!  
  
Idea developed in 2021-2022.
